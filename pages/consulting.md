Development research in East Africa has been my professional focus since 2019. I have spent several years living and working in the region: for UNDP (Kenya, 2019-20), Forcier Consulting (South Sudan, 2022-24) and now part-time with OTHERwise Research (remote with travel to South Sudan, 2024-present). Building on this experience, I am currently writing a PhD on topics related to development, fragility, and state formation in East Africa.
<br><br>
During this time I have had the pleasure to work on over a dozen research consultancies with governments, various UN agencies, (I)NGOs, charities, CSOs, and national development agencies. My sectoral focus is broad, covering displacement, education, health, and livelihoods-related projects. Methodologically, I am a mixed methods researcher with a quant focus and graduate-level training in econometrics, statistics, and GIS analysis. 
<br><br>
Most of my consulting engagements have been in South Sudan, where I have a number of ongoing research projects and a substantial local network, and routinely advise on program design and political economy.

Please do reach out if you are interested in working together or discussing any area related to my experience.
