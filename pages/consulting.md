<br><br>
Development research in East Africa has been my professional focus since 2019, working with: UNDP (Kenya, 2019-20), Forcier Consulting (South Sudan, 2022-24), and now OTHERwise Research (part-time with travel to South Sudan, 2024-present). I am currently writing a PhD on development and political economy in East Africa.
<br><br>
I have had the pleasure to work on over a dozen research consultancies with governments, UN agencies, (I)NGOs, charities, and CSOs, covering displacement, education, health and livelihoods. Methodologically, I am a mixed methods researcher with a quantitative background and training in econometrics, statistics, and GIS analysis. 
<br><br>
Most of my consulting engagements have been in South Sudan, where I have a number of ongoing research projects, a substantial local network, and routinely advise on implementation logistics and research design. I have also assisted research undertaken in Kenya, DRC, and Mozambique.
