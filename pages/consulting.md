Development in East Africa has been my professional focus since 2019. I have spent several years living, working, and conducting research in the region: for UNDP (Kenya, 2019-20), Forcier Consulting (South Sudan, 2022-24) and now part-time with OTHERwise Research (remote with travel to South Sudan, 2024-present). During this time I have had the pleasure to work on over a dozen research consultancies with governments, various UN agencies, (I)NGOs, charities, CSOs, and national development agencies. My sectoral focus is broad, having completed a mix of displacement, education, health, and livelihoods-related projects. Methodologically, I am a mixed methods researcher with a mostly quant focus, having undertaken postgraduate-level training in econometrics, statistics, and GIS analysis.

Most of my consulting engagements have been in South Sudan, where I have a number of ongoing research projects, a substantial local network, and advise on program design and political economy. If you are planning a development program or research project in South Sudan, please do reach out if you are interested in working together.
