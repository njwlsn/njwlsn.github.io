Development in East Africa has been my focus since 2019. I have spent several years living and working in the region, mostly in research: for UNDP (Nairobi, 2019-20), Forcier Consulting (Juba, 2022-24) and now part-time with OTHERwise Research (remote with travel to Juba, 2024-present). During this time I have had the pleasure to work on over a dozen development-focused consultancies in the region with governments, various UN agencies, (I)NGOs, charities, CSOs, and national development agencies. Most of my consulting engagements have been in South Sudan, where I have several ongoing projects. My sectoral focus is broad, having completed a fairly even mix of education, health, and livelihoods-related projects.

If your organization is preparing to tender a development-focused consulting opportunity in East Africa, particularly in South Sudan, I invite you to reach out to discuss how I may be able to support your objectives.
