Motivated by my time living and working in Kenya, my first solo-authored paper examines the effects of exposure to clientelist land reforms in Central Kenya and the Rift Valley. I study two major land redistribution policies - the colonial era 'White Highlands' policy and independence era 'Settlement Schemes' - to examine if and how exposure to these schemes affect what I broadly term 'social violence': conflict, fear, and mistrust. Through empirical analysis of geocoded conflict and survey data, I suggest that the long-run effects of exposure to each scheme differ, with these differences driven by the respective histories of land allocation in each area.
