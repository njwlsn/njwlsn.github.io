From the start of 2023 to date, I have managed research in South Sudan for the <a href="https://inee.org/data-evidence/ericc">Education Research in Conflict and Protracted Crisis (ERICC)</a> programme, coordinated by IRC and funded by FCDO. ERICC is being implemented in seven different countries - Bangladesh (Coxâ€™s Bazar), Jordan, Lebanon, Myanmar, Nigeria, South Sudan and Syria - and seeks to identify the most effective approaches for improving access, quality, and continuity of education to support sustainable and coherent education systems and holistic learning and development of children in conflict and crisis.
