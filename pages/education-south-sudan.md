Since the start of 2023, I have managed research conducted in South Sudan under the <a href="https://inee.org/data-evidence/ericc">Education Research in Conflict and Protracted Crisis (ERICC)</a> programme, coordinated by IRC and funded by FCDO. ERICC is being implemented in 7 countries - Bangladesh, Jordan, Lebanon, Myanmar, Nigeria, South Sudan, Syria - and seeks to identify approaches for improving access, quality, and continuity of education in crisis contexts. Our work in South Sudan comprises an evidence review, a research agenda, a political economy analysis, and a pastoralist education study.
