I manage research in South Sudan under the <a href="https://inee.org/data-evidence/ericc">Education Research in Conflict and Protracted Crisis (ERICC)</a> programme, coordinated by IRC and funded by FCDO. ERICC is being implemented in seven different countries - Bangladesh, Jordan, Lebanon, Myanmar, Nigeria, South Sudan, Syria - and seeks to identify the most effective approaches for improving access, quality, and continuity of education in crisis contexts.
